			<span>I got this loaf of Rosemary Olive from </span> <a class="text-yellow-700" href="https://www.purebread.ca/">Purebread</a> <span> last Saturday.</span>
			<div>It was a great buying experience. </div>
			<div>This is what's left of it after a day and a half. </div>

			<div class="text-2xl text-orange-400">Overall rating 5.5/10</div>
			<div class="w-72 pt-4">The olives in this loaf were the only dashes of flavour to be found; mrs. rosemary has gone missing. 
				There was no dispersion of savour throughout the white crumb. 
				The crust had a great crunch factor but was difficult to cut.
			</div>
			<div class="pt-4 w-72">
				I enjoyed this bread most lightly toasted with generous butter.
