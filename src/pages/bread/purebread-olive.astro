			<span>I got this loaf of Rosemary Olive from Purebread last Saturday. This is what's left of it after a day and a half:</span>

				<Toasters numToasters={5}/>

			</div>
			<div>Despite eating this quickly, I was a little disappointed with this loaf.</div>
			<div class="">The flavour was poorly dispersed. The olives were the only dominant pockets, rosemary was an afterthought. The crumb was very white and leaned dry. The crust had a satisfying crunch factor but was difficult to cut.
			</div>
			<div class="">
				I enjoyed this bread most lightly toasted with generous butter.
			</div>

			<div>It's clear the staff at Purebread enjoy being there. Plus one toaster for the excellent service.</div>
