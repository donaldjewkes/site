			<div>This sourdough was particularly pretty. It was reminiscent of a dark rye but there were visible pockets of chocolate throughout.</div>
			<div class="">There is a nutty bitterness that will appease dark chocolate enthusiasts. I found the chocolate gave the crumb a nice moisture.

				I enjoyed this bread most toasted with a light coating of warm peanut butter.
